# Challenges
The “How People Shop” (HPS) product aims to revolutionize the way IKEA understands and interacts with its customers. By leveraging advanced data analytics and a robust technological infrastructure, HPS provides deep insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and shopping journeys. The ultimate goal is to enhance the IKEA omnichannel experience, driving innovation, customer satisfaction, and business growth.

HPS integrates data from multiple sources, including online and offline interactions, CRM systems, social media, and IoT devices. This integration provides a holistic view of the customer journey, ensuring that IKEA can optimize each interaction across all channels and touchpoints, such as websites, physical stores, and social media platforms. Providing data-driven insights, HPS can support strategic decisions related to product development, marketing campaigns, and store operations.

HPS can brings value to a lot of different sections within the organisation, at a global scale. This technically translates in several challenges.

In order to provide insights to all the regions, granting a great level of the service to all the franchisees, ideally all data should be globally consistent. This challenge can be broken down in 2 macro topics, that involve the technical and the business sides of the organisation:
- Existence and Availability of the Data Generating Process at a global scale:
    - Comprehensive Data Collection: For HPS to be effective, it must ensure that data collection processes are established and functioning in every region where IKEA operates. This includes the setup of sensors, tracking tools, and systems to capture data from physical stores, websites, mobile apps, social media platforms, and other customer interaction points.
    - Standardized Data Metrics: It is crucial to define and implement standardized metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) across all regions. This standardization ensures that data collected from different regions is comparable and can be aggregated for a global view.
    - Training and Compliance: Employees in each region need to be trained on the data generation processes and the importance of consistent data collection. Additionally, compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, must be maintained across all regions.

- Data Replication Across Regions
    - Consistency: To achieve global consistency, data collected from various regions needs to be replicated and synchronized. This ensures, for example, that insights drawn from one region can be reliably compared with those from another.
    - Redundancy: Replication also provides redundancy, ensuring that data is not lost due to regional system failures or other disruptions.
    - Cost Management: If not managed properly, this process involves additional costs that risk to scale potentially faster than the incremental value given by the addition of a new country/region.

Solutions:
- Data Audit: Choose a couple regions and assess the existence and availability of the data generating process, and the status of the data collection.
- Unified Data Collection Framework: Develop and implement a unified data collection framework that standardizes the types of data collected, methods, and tools used across all regions.
- Standardise Data Metrics: Define and maintaine data standards and KPIs.
- Training and Compliance: Develop and roll out global training initiatives focusing on data collection best practices, tools usage, and compliance with data privacy laws.
- Global Data Synchronization Protocols for cross-region Data Replication: Develop and enforce global data synchronization protocols that define how and when data should be replicated across regions, and adopt version control systems to manage changes and updates to data schemas and structures, ensuring consistency.
