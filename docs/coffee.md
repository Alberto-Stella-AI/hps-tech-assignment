# Calculation of Total Cups of Coffee Consumed by the HPS Product Team Each Sprint
To estimate the amount of cups of coffee consumed by the team each sprint during the development of HPS, 3 main factors have to be considered: the team composition, the average consumption of cofeee per day, the length of a sprint.
Let's proceed in order.
### Step 1: Determine the Team Composition


- 3 Data Engineers: To design, build, and maintain the infrastructure necessary for collecting, storing, and processing large datasets. They ensure data pipelines are efficient, scalable, and well integrated in the cloud platform.

- 2 Software Developers: Software Developers are responsible for building and maintaining the software applications that comprise the HPS product. They develop features related to the microservices, to the cloud infrastructure, and to the frontend.

- 1 UX/UI Designers: UX/UI Designers focus on the user experience and interface design of the HPS product. They ensure that the product is intuitive, accessible, and engaging for users, which is critical for driving user adoption and satisfaction.

- 1 QA/Tester: They are responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of the HPS product. They conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, verify that new features work as intended, and maintain the overall performance and stability of the product.

- 1 Data Scientist: To analyze the vast amounts of data generated by HPS, and to anticipate the development of an AI solution that provides additional insights. Their analyses help inform product development, marketing strategies, and operational improvements.

- 1 Product Manager: to oversees the HPS product’s vision, strategy, and roadmap. They ensure that the product aligns with business goals and customer needs, coordinate between different departments, and make strategic decisions to drive the product’s success.

<u>This totals to a team of 9 members</u>

### Step 2: Determine the Average Number of Cups of Coffee per Day per Person
Assume, based on typical office consumption data, each team member drinks an average of 3 cups of coffee per day.

### Step 3: Determine the Length of a Sprint
Assume each sprint is 2 weeks long, meaning 10 working days.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Cups of Coffee Consumed Each Sprint
Using the formula:
$$
\text{Total cups of coffee} = \text{Number of team members} \times \text{Average cups per day} \times \text{Number of working days in a sprint}
$$

Substituting the values:
$$
\text{Total cups of coffee} = 9 \text{ team members} \times 3 \text{ cups per day} \times 10 \text{ working days} = 270
$$

<u>The HPS product team consumes a total of **450 cups of coffee each sprint**.</u>
